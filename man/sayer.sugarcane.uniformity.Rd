1933 Experiment

First experiment was conducted in 1933 at Meghaul (Monghyr).
A road was cut through the field, creating blocks 480 ft x 315 ft and 480 ft x 93 ft. (See Plate XLI).
There were 136 rows, 3 feet apart, 480 feet long each.  It required 16 days to harvest the 1088 plots.
Each plot was 1/242 acre. The authors conclude that long narrow plots of 12/242 to 16/242 acre would be best.

Field width: 8 plots * 60 feet = 480 feet

Field length: 136 rows * 3 feet = 408 feet

1934 Experiment

This experiment was conducted at the New Area, Pusa.  The experiment was laid out in 6 blocks, each separated by a 3-foot bund.  The cutting of the canes began in Jan 1934, taking 24 days. (An earthquake 15 January delayed harvesting).
Conclusion: Variation is reduced by increasing the plot size up to 9/242 acre.

Field width: 8 plots * 60 feet = 480 feet

Field length: 121 rows * 3 feet = 363 feet
