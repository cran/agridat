  Plant strength of perennial ryegrass in France

\description{
  Plant strength of perennial ryegrass in France for 21 genotypes at 7
  locations.

\usage{data(denis.ryegrass)}
\format{
  A data frame with 147 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{gen}}{Genotype factor, 21 levels}
    \item{\code{loc}}{Location factor, 7 levels}
    \item{\code{strength}}{Average plant strength * 100}
  }
}
\details{
  INRA conducted a breeding trial in western France with 21 genotypes at
  7 locations.  The observed data is 'strength' averaged over 7-10
  plants per plot and three plot per location (after adjusting for
  blocking effects).  Each plant was scored on a scale 0-9.
  The original data had a value of 86.0 for genotype G1 at location
  L4--this was replaced by an additive estimated value of 361.2 as in
  Gower and Hand (1996).
