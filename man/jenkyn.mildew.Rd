    Yields from treatment for mildew control
}
\usage{data(jenkyn.mildew)}
\format{
  A data frame with 38 observations on the following 4 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{plot}}{plot number}
    \item{\code{trt}}{treatment factor, 4 levels}
    \item{\code{block}}{block factor, 9 levels}
    \item{\code{yield}}{grain yield, tons/ha}
  }
}
\details{

  There were four spray treatments: 0 (none), 1 (early), 2 (late), R
  (repeated).
  
  Each treatment occurs once between each f the 9 ordered pairs of the
  other treatments.
  
  The first and last plot are not assigned to a block.
