\usage{data(kalamkar.potato.uniformity)}
\format{
  A data frame with 576 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{row}}{row number, 1-96}
    \item{\code{col}}{column number, 1-6}
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield of potatoes per plot}
  }
}
\details{
  The data is for potato yields in 96 rows, each 132 feet long, with 3
  feet between rows.

  Each row was harvested as six plots, each 22 feet long.  Each hill had
  one seed piece.  Hills were spaced 2 feet apart in each row.
