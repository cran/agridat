  Uniformity trial of potatoes
}
\description{
  Uniformity trial of potatoes at Saskatchewan, Canada, 1929.
}
\usage{data("kalamkar.potato.uniformity")}
\format{
  A data frame with 576 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{row}}{row}
    \item{\code{col}}{column}
    \item{\code{yield}}{yield of potatoes per plot}
  }
}
\details{
  The data is for potato yields in 96 rows, each 132 feet long, with 3
  feet between rows.

  Each row was harvested as six plots, each 22 feet long.  Each hill had
  one seed piece.  Hills were spaced 2 feet apart in each row.

  Field width: 6 plots * 22 feet = 132 feet

  Field length: 96 rows * 3 feet = 288 feet
