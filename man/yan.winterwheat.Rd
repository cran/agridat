\title{
  Multi-environment trial of Winter Wheat in Ontario
}
\description{
  Yield of 18 varieties of winter wheat grown at 9 environments in
  Ontario in 1993.
}
\details{
  The yield is the mean of several reps, measured in metric tons per hectare.

  This data has often been used to illustrate GGE biplots.
