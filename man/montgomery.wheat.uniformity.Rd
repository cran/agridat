\details{

  Experiments were conducted by the Nebraska Experiment Station.
  
  A field was sown to Turkey winter wheat in the fall of 1908 and
  harvested in 1909.  The drill, 5.5 feet wide, was driven across the
  first series of 14 blocks, the boundaries of the blocks being later
  established.  Each series was sown the same way, no space was allowed
  between the blocks.  Each block was 5.5 ft square.

  The experiment was done 3 times with harvests in 1909, 1910, 1911.
  A simple heatmap of the 3 years' yields are shown in Montgomery
  (1912), figure 3, p. 178.
  
  The 1909 data are given by Montgomery (1913), figure 10, page
  37. NOTE: North is at the right side of this diagram.

  The 1910 data are not available.
  
  The 1911 data are given by Montgomery (1912), figure 1, page
  165. NOTE: North is at the top of this diagram.

  Surface & Pearl (1916) give a simple method for adjusting yield due to
  fertility effects using the 1909 data.

  Field length: 16 blocks

  Field width: 14 plots
