  Uniformity trial of strawberry
}
\usage{data("baker.strawberry.uniformity")}
\format{
  A data frame with 700 observations on the following 4 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{trial}}{a factor with levels \code{T1} \code{T2}}
    \item{\code{row}}{a numeric vector}
    \item{\code{col}}{a numeric vector}
    \item{\code{yield}}{a numeric vector}
  }
}
\details{
  In trial T1, 200 plants were grown in two double-row beds at Davis,
  CA, in 1946. The rows were 1 foot apart. The beds were 42 inches
  apart. The plants were 10 inches apart within a row, each row
  consisting of 50 plants.

  Field length: 50 plants * 10 inches = 500 inches.

  Field width: 12 in + 42 in + 12 in =

  In trial T2, 500 plants were grown in single beds. The beds were 30
  inches apart. Each bed was 50 plants long with 10 inches between
  plants.

  Field length: 50 plants * 10 in = 500 in.

  Field width: 10 beds * 30 in = 300 in.
