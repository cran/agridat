\description{
  Phytophtera disease incidence in a pepper field
}

\format{
  A data frame with 800 observations on the following 6 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{field}}{field factor, 2 levels}
    \item{\code{row}}{x ordinate}
    \item{\code{quadrat}}{y ordinate}
    \item{\code{disease}}{presence (1) or absence (0) of disease}
    \item{\code{water}}{soil moisture percent}
    \item{\code{leaf}}{leaf assay count}
  }
}
\details{
  Each field is 20 rows by 20 quadrates, with 2 to 3 bell pepper plants
  per plot.  If any plant was wilted, dead, or had lesions, the
  Phytophthora disease was considered to be present in the plot.  The
  soil pathogen load was assayed as the number of leaf disks colonized
  out of five.  In field 2, the pattern of disease presence appears to
  follow soil water content.  In field 1, no obvious trends were
  present.

  Gumpertz et al. model the presence of disease  using soil moisture and
  leaf assay as covariates, and using disease presence of neighboring
  plots as covariates in an autologistic model.
