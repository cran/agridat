Uniformity trial of wheat
}
\description{
A uniformity trial of 1500 plots of wheat conducted in Idaho in 1927.
}
\usage{data(wiebe.wheat)}
\format{
  A data frame with 1500 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{row}}{Row}
    \item{\code{col}}{Column (series)}
    \item{\code{yield}}{Yield in grams per plot}
  }
}

\details{
  Yield trial conducted in 1927 near Aberdeen, Idaho.  The crop was
  Federation wheat (C.I. no 4734). Plots were seeded
  on April 18 with a drill that sowed eight rows at a time.
  Individual rows were harvested in August and threshed with a small
  nursery thresher.
  
  Rows were 15 feet long, 1 foot apart.
  
  Some authors recommend analyzing the square root of the yields.

  Produced by the U.S. Dept of Agriculture.
