\format{
  A data frame with 204 observations on the following 3 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{row}}{Row, numeric}
    \item{\code{section}}{Section, numeric}
    \item{\code{yield}}{Yield, in pounds}

\details{
  In 1909, potatoes were harvested from uniform land.  There were 34
  rows, 34 inches apart.  Each row was harvested in 6 sections, each
  being 72 feet, 7 inches long.
