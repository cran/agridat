\details{
  
  Data was collected in 1951 (Hayman 1954a) and 1952 (Hayman 1954b).

  In each year there were 8 varieties of Aztec tobacco, \emph{Nicotiana rustica L.}.

  Each cross/self was represented by 10 progeny, in two plots of 5
  plants each.  The data are the mean flowering time per plot.

  Note, the 1951 data as published in Hayman (1954a) Table 5 contain
  "10 times the mean flowering time".  The data here have been divided
  by 10 so as to be comparable with the 1952 data.

  Hayman (1954b) says "Table 2 lists...three characters from a diallel
  cross of Nicotiana rustica varieties which was repeated for three years."
  This seems to indicate that the varieties are the same in 1951 and
  1952.  Calculating the GCA effects separately for 1951 and 1952 and
  then comparing these estimates shows that they are highly correlated.
