\usage{data(mead.strawberry)}
\format{
  A data frame with 32 observations on the following 5 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{row}}{Row}
    \item{\code{col}}{Column}
    \item{\code{block}}{Block factor, 4 levels}
    \item{\code{gen}}{Genotype factor, 8 levels}
    \item{\code{yield}}{Yield, pounds}
  }
}
\details{
  A hedge along the right side (column 8) caused shading and lower
  yields.

  R. Mead said (in a discussion of the Besag & Higdon paper),
  "the blocks defined (as given to me by the experimenter)
  are the entire horizontal rows...the design of the trial is actually
  (and unrecognized by me also) a checker-board of eight half-blocks
  with two groups of split-plot varieties".

  The two sub-groups of genotypes are G, V, R1, F and Re, M, E, P.

  Unknown, but prior to 1968 according to Besag. Probably via R. Mead.
