\usage{data(jansen.strawberry)}
\format{
  A data frame with 144 observations on the following 5 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{male}}{male parent}
    \item{\code{female}}{female parent}
    \item{\code{block}}{block factor, 4 levels}
    \item{\code{category}}{a factor with levels \code{C1} \code{C2} \code{C3}}
    \item{\code{count}}{number of plants in each category}
  }
}
\details{
  Red core disease is caused by a fungus, \emph{Phytophtora fragariae}.
  12 populations of strawberries were arranged in four blocks.  In each
  plot, 9 or 10 plants were assessed for damage from the fungus and
  rated as belonging to category C1, C2, or C3 (increasing damage).  The
  12 populations were created from a cross of 3 male parents and 4
  (different) female parents.
