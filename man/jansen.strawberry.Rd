  Ordered disease ratings on strawberry crosses.
}
\usage{data(jansen.strawberry)}
\format{
  A data frame with 144 observations on the following 5 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{male}}{male parent}
    \item{\code{female}}{female parent}
    \item{\code{block}}{block factor, 4 levels}
    \item{\code{category}}{a factor with levels \code{C1} \code{C2} \code{C3}}
    \item{\code{count}}{number of plants in each category}
  }
}
\details{
  There were 3 male strawberry plants and 4 different female strawberry
  plants that were crossed to create 12 populations.

  The experiment had four blocks with 12 plots each (one for each
  population).  In each plot, 9 or 10 plants were assessed for damage
  from fungus and rated as belonging to category C1, C2, or C3
  (increasing damage).
  
  Red core disease is caused by a fungus, \emph{Phytophtora fragariae}.
