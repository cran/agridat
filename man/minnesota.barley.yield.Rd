\details{

  The \code{lattice} package contains a smaller version of this data for
  the years 1931 and 1932.  
  
  The following comments are in reference to the mentioned source
  documents.
  
  Notes about Immer (1934).

  The University Farm location is at the city of Saint Paul.

  This source provides the yield data for each of the three blocks at
  each location in 1931 and 1932.  The following registration numbers
  and names are given: 
  
  \tabular{ll}{
    Minn 184 \tab  Manchuria \cr
    Minn 445 \tab  Glabron \cr
    Minn 440 \tab  Svansota \cr
    Minn 447 \tab  Velvet \cr
    Minn 448 \tab  Trebi \cr
    Minn 457 \tab  Manchuria x Smooth Awn \cr
    Minn 462 \tab  Smooth Awn x Manchuria \cr
    Minn 452 \tab  Peatland \cr
    Minn 475 \tab  Svanhals x Lion \cr
    Minn 529 \tab  Wisconsin No 38 \cr
  }

  Notes about Harlan (1935):

  The 1931 yields match the average values of Immer (1934).
  
  The Minnesota 474 and 475 cultivars are both 'Svanhals x Lion' crosses.
  
  No yields are reported at Crookston in 1928 because of a crop failure. (Page 20)
  
  Also, in the report for North Dakota it says
  "the zero yields at Williston, ND in 1931 were caused by drought". (Page 31)


  Notes about Wiebe (1940):

  The 1932 data generally match the average values from Immer (1934)
  with the following notes.
  
  The 'Svanhals x Lion' cultivar is the same as 'Minnesota 474'.
  
  The data for Glabron at St Paul in 1932 are missing, but given as 36.8
  in Immer (1934).  This value is treated as missing this R dataset.
  
  The yield for 'Wisconsin 38' at St Paul in 1932 is shown as 3.80, but
  38 in Immer (1934).  The latter value is used in this R dataset.

  No yields are reported at Morris in 1933 and 1934, because of a crop
  failure owing to drought.
  

  Notes about Hayes (1942).
  
  This sources gives the block-level yield data for 5 cultivars at 4
  sites in 1932 and 1935.  Cultivar 'Barbless' is the same as 'Wisconsin
  No38'.
