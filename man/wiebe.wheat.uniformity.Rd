\details{
  Yield trial conducted in 1927 near Aberdeen, Idaho.  The crop was
  Federation wheat (C.I. no 4734). Plots were seeded
  on April 18 with a drill that sowed eight rows at a time.
  Individual rows were harvested in August and threshed with a small
  nursery thresher.
  Some authors recommend analyzing the square root of the yields.

  Rows were 15 feet long, 1 foot apart.

  Field width: 12 cols * 15 feet = 180 feet wide.

  Field length: 125 rows * 12 in = 125 feet

# Wilkinson (1983, p. 152) noted that an 8-row planter was used which

# in the high autocorrelations of row means at lag 8 and lag 16
