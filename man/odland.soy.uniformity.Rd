\details{

Grown at West Virginia Experiment Station in 1925/1926.  Soybeans were
planted in rows 30 inches apart.

In 1925 the crop was harvested for forage, 42 rows, each 200 feet long.
Yields of 8-foot plats recorded.

In 1926 the crop was harvested for seed, 55 rows, each 232 feet
long. Yields of 8-foot plats were recorded.

In 1926, data for the last row seems to partially missing.

Odland and Garber provide no agronomic context for the yield variation.
