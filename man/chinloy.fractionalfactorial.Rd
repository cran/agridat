\details{

  An experiment grown in 1949 at the Worthy Park Estate in Jamaica.
  
  Nitrogen was applied as sulphate of ammonia at 0, 3, 6 hundred-weight
  per acre.

  Phosphorous was applied as superphosphate at 0, 4, 8 hundred-weight
  per acre.
  
  Potassium was applied as muriate of potash at 0, 1, 2 hundred-weight
  per acre.
  
  Bagasse applied pre-plant at 0, 20, 40 tons per acre.

  Filter press mud applied pre-plant at 0, 10, 20 tons per acre.
  
  Each plot was 18 yards long by 6 yards (3 rows) wide. Plots were
  arranged in nine columns of nine, a 2-yard space separating plots
  along the rows and two guard rows separating plots across the rows.
  
  Field length: 18 yards * 9 plots + 2 yards * 8 gaps = 178 yards

  Field width: 6 yards * 9 plots + 4 yards * 8 gaps = 86 yards
