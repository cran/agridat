\description{
  Counts of yellow/white and sweet/starchy kernels on each of 4 maize
  ears by 15 observers.

\usage{pearl.kernels}
\format{
  A data frame with 59 observations on the following 6 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{ear}}{Factor for ear 8, 9, 10, 11}
    \item{\code{obs}}{Factor for observer, 1-15}
    \item{\code{ys}}{Number of yellow starchy kernels}
    \item{\code{yt}}{Yellow sweet}

\details{
  An ear of white sweet corn was crossed with an ear of yellow starchy
  corn.  The F1 kernels of the cross were grown and a sample of four
  ears was harvested. The F2 kernels of these ears were classified by
  each of 15 observers into white/yellow and sweet/starchy.

  By Mendelian genetics, the kernels should occur in the
  ratio 9 yellow starch, 3 white starch, 3 yellow sweet,
  1 white sweet.

  The observers had the following positions:
