\description{
    Phenotypic and genotypic data for a barley population of Steptoe x
    Morex.  There were 150 doubled haploid crosses, evaluated at 223

  \code{steptoe.morex.geno} is a \code{cross} object from the

\details{

As described by Hayes et al (1993), a population of 150 barley doubled
haploid (DH) lines was developed by the Oregon State University Barley
Breeding Program for the North American Barley Genome Mapping
Project. The parentage of the population is Steptoe / Morex.

Steptoe is the dominant feed barley in the northwestern U.S.

Morex is the spring U.S. malting quality standard.

Seed from a single head of each parent was used to create the F1, from which a
set of 150 lines was developed.

Phenotypic values for the parents Steptoe and Morex are here:
\url{http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/SxM/parental_values.html}
There are 16 locations, The average across locations is in column 17.  Not all
traits were collected at every location.  At each location, all 150 lines were
included in block 1, a random subset of 50 lines was used in block 2.

The traits are:
Alpha Amylase (20 Deg Units),
Diastatic Power (Deg Units),
Heading Date (Julian Days),
Lodging (percent),
Malt Extract (percent),
Grain Protein (percent),
Grain Yield (Mt/Ha).

Phenotypic values of the 150 lines in the F1 population are here:
\url{http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/SxM/phenotypes.html}
Each trait is in a different file, in which each block of numbers represents
one location.

The 223-markers Steptoe/Morex base map is here:
\url{http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/SxM/smbasev2.map}.
The data for these markers on the 150 lines is
\url{http://wheat.pw.usda.gov/ggpages/SxM/smbasev2.mrk}.
These were hand-assembled (e.g. marker distances were
cumulated to marker positions) into a .csv file which was then imported into
R using \code{qtl::read.cross}.  The class was manually changed from
c('bc','cross') to c('dh','cross').

The marker data is coded as A = Steptoe, B = Morex, - = missing.

The pedigrees for the 150 lines are found here:
