\details{

  Experiments were conducted at the Agricultural Experiment Station Farm
  at Eloy, Arizona. The crop was harvested in July 1958.

  The crop was planted in two rows 12 inches apart on vegetable beds 40
  inches center to center.

  In each test, the end ranges and one row of plots on one side were
  next to alleys, and those plots gave estimates of border effects. 

  \bold{Experiment E4 (four foot test)}.

  Sandy streaks were present in the field. Average yield was 1487
  lb/ac. A diagonal fertility gradient was in this field.  Widening the
  plot was equally effective as lengthening the plot to reduce
  variability.  The optimum plot size was 1 bed wide, 24 feet long.
  Considering economic costs, the optimum size was 1 bed, 12 feet long.

  Field length: 18 ranges * 4 feet = 72 feet

  Field width: 16 beds * 3.33 = 53 feet


  \bold{Experiment E5 (five foot test)}

  Average yield 2517 lb/ac, typical for this crop.  Combining plots
  lengthwise was more effective than widening the plots, in order to
  reduce variability. The optimum plot size was 1 bed wide, 25 feet
  long.
  Considering economic costs, the optimum size was 1 bed, 18 feet long.

  Field length: 18 ranges * 5 feet = 90 feet.

  Field width: 14 beds * 3.33 = 46.6 feet.
