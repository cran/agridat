\details{
  An experiment conducted in 1951 and described in Federer (1954).  The
  treatment involved exposing tobacco seeds to seven different doses of
  radiation.  The seedlings were transplanted to the field in an RCB
  experiment with 7 treatments in 8 blocks.  The physical layout of the
  experiment was in 8 rows and 7 columns.  Shortly after the plants were
  transplanted to the field it became apparent that an environmental
  gradient existed. The response variable was the total height
  (centimeters) of 20 plants.
