\format{
  A data frame with 1300 observations on the following 7 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{row}}{row}
    \item{\code{col}}{column}
    \item{\code{y}}{count of webworms}
    \item{\code{block}}{block factor}

\details{

  The beet webworm lays egg masses as small as 1 egg, seldom exceeding 5
  eggs. The larvae can move freely, but usually mature on the plant on
  which they hatch.

  Each plot contained 25 unit areas, each 1 row by 3 feet long.

  Treatment 1 = None.  Treatment 2 = Contact spray. Treatment 3 = Lead
  arsenate. Treatment 4 = Both spray, lead arsenate.
