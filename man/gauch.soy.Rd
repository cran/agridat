\usage{data(gauch.soy)}
\format{
  A data frame with 1454 observations on the following 4 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{yield}}{Yield kg/ha}
    \item{\code{rep}}{Repeated measurement}
    \item{\code{gen}}{Genotype factor, 7 levels}
    \item{\code{env}}{Environment factor, 55 levels}

\details{
  Soybean yields at 13 percent moisture for 7 genotypes in 55
  environments with 4 replicates.  Some environments had only 2 or 3
  replicates.  The experiment was an RCB design, but some plots were
  missing and there were many other soybean varieties in the experiment.
  The replications appear in random order and do _NOT_ define blocks.
  Environment names are a combination of the first letter of the
  location name and the last two digits of the year.  The location codes
  are C=Chazy, N=Canton, L=Lockport, G=Geneseo, R=Romulus, A=Aurora,
  I=Ithica, V=Valatie, D=Riverhead.
  Plots were 7.6 m long, four rows wide (middle two rows were
  harvested).

  This data has been widely used (in various subsets)
  to promote the benefits of AMMI (Additive Main Effects
  Multiplicative Interactions) analyses.

  The gen x env means of Table 1 (Zobel et al 1998) are least-squares
  means (personal communication).
