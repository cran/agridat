\details{
  Corn yield response to nitrogen fertilizer for a single variety of
  corn at two locations in Tennessee over five years.
  The yield data is the mean of 9 replicates.  The original
  paper fits quadratic curves to the data.  Schabenberger and Pierce fit
  multiple models including linear plateau.  The example below fits a
  quadratic plateau for one year/loc.  In the original paper, the 1965
  and 1966 data for the Knoxville location was not used as it appeared
  that the response due to nitrogen was minimal in 1965 and nonexistant
  in 1966.  The economic optimum can be found by setting the tangent
