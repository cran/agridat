  Uniformity trials of oat hay and wheat

\description{
  Uniformity trials of oat straw and wheat
}

\format{
  A data frame with 270 observations on the following 4 variables.
  \describe{
    \item{\code{row}}{row ordinate}
    \item{\code{col}}{column ordinate}
    \item{\code{oats}}{yield of oat hay}
    \item{\code{wheat}}{yield of wheat grain}
  }
}
\details{
  In 1923 the field was planted to oats and harvested as hay.  In 1924
  the field was planted to wheat and harvested for grain.
  
  Garber: "Plots 211 to 214, and 261 to 264, [note, these are rows
  11-14, columns 5-6] inclusive, were eliminated from this study because
  of the fact that a few years ago a straw stack had stood on or in the
  vicinity...which undoubtedly accounts for the relatively high yields
  on plots 261 to 264, inclusive."

  Note: The source document contained mean-subtracted yields.  The oat
  yield in row 22, column 5 was given as +59.7.  This is obviously
  incorrect, since the negative yields all end in '.7' and positive
  yields all ended in '.3'.  We used -59.7 as the centered yield value
  and added the mean of 1883.7 to all centered yields to obtain absolute
  yields.
